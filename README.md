#Polymorphic Service Delivery

  Organizations face increasing cyber threats targeting static web server configurations, yet complex Moving Target Defense (MTD) solutions, such as IP randomization or VM migration, are often cost-prohibitive for resource-constrained environments. This research introduces Polymorphic Service Delivery (PSD), a lightweight MTD strategy that uses standard Linux utilities (iptables, cron) to dynamically rotate web server daemons (Apache2, Lighttpd, H2O), mitigating service-based exploitation. Using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), we developed a PSD artifact deployed in a live Internet-facing environment for four months, recording 461,613 attacks among 636,166 HTTP requests. Two instantiations were evaluated: Instantiation 1 with 3-minute rotation intervals and Instantiation 2 with 3-second rotation intervals. By leveraging Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) for randomized internal port remapping, PSD disrupted 73% of attacks, including path traversal and reconnaissance, while maintaining seamless connectivity for legitimate users. PSDâ€™s simplicity enables rapid deployment on front-facing servers for stateless web applications, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional MTD with no downtime or performance overhead.
